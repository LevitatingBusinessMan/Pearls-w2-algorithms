# Pearl 001 - Algorithmics assignment
This includes the main assignemnt and both bonus assignments.

Additions were made to `dup.py` and `sort.py`, so those files are included in this zip.

There is a test file called `test.py`.
This uses two test text files `tbrian.txt` and `tgrail.txt`.
The test file does not output anything by default.
But one can read it to see the assertions.
